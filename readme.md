### ‚öôÔ∏è Previous Settings

- ***config.php file***

config.php it's the file in wich we will have our first contact with the API, in here you must change the next fields with the ones that correspond to your project.

1. **The route of your project:**

    define('BASE_PATH', $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/YOUR ROUTE');

This constant it's important, because if the one that it's going to link the project with the files that it require. <br>
To fullfil it, you need to change the last parameter where contains 'YOUR ROUTE'. <br>
The structure of the link need to be with a slash '/' at the beginning. <br>

2. **Deep of your project**

    define('DEEP_PROJECT', 'DEEP OF YOUR PROJECT {INT}. EX: 2');

This parameter could be confusing, but it's only how much folders are before the root or main of your project. <br>
ü§î For Example, if the main of your project it's 'C:/Users/X/xampp/htdocs/project-root' and your API it's inside the folder API 'C:/Users/X/xampp/htdocs/project-root/API/' then the deep will we root + the folders between the main folder and the API + the folder of the API. 'project-root' it's the main of the project (0) + we don't have folders beetween + '/API' main folder of the API (1) = deep of the project (1). <br>
Remember that this value need to be like a integer and without quotes.

3. **API KEY**

    define('API_KEY', 'YOUR API KEY');

If you don't have stablish an API KEY, your API it's always going to return "NOT API KEY". <br>
Why? Because the API KEY it's send by header, so first you need to add the API KEY into the parameter (this could be in whatever type of encryptation). Then you must sent it by a header called **auth**. <br><br>
All of these are important steps to make your API work correctly, once time done you could run it.
